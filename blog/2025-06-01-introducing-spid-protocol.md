As AI evolves, we hear a lot about the power of large language models, reasoning engines, and generative capabilities.  
But thereâ€™s a hidden layer few are addressing: how AI-generated interactions actually reach human beings.

SPID Protocol provides a universal consent framework to govern AI delivery â€” enabling lawful, trusted, regulator-compliant agent-to-human communications.

We invite regulators, standards bodies, compliance teams, and responsible AI builders to join the open development of SPID Protocol as a global infrastructure layer for trusted AI communication.
